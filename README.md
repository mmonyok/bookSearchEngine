## Description
- I wanted to better learn how MERN stack development works, so I built this web application.
- If you are wanting a nice concise location to store your to-do book reading list, you can you this application as it allow you to use the extensive Google Books API and save books to your user list.
- I learned a lot about JWTs, connecting the back and front of a MERN stack application, and how to debug network issues.
